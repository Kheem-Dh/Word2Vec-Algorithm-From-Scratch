Today we will be learning about the fundamentals of data science and statistics. Data Science and statistics are hot and growing fields with
alternative names of machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data, etc. I'm really excited to talk to you about data science and
statistics because data science and statistics have long been passions of mine. I didn't use to be very good at data science and statistics but
after studying data science and statistics for a long time, I got better and better at it until I became a data science and statistics
expert. I'm really excited to talk to you about data science and statistics, thanks for listening to me talk about data science and
statistics.
